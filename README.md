# 4X_Game

The goal is to create a "story generator" game akin to Rimworld but 4X (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) and with fleshed out ecosystems and independent npc ai. 
The initial prototype is to create a simple ecosystem with a band of hunter gatherer humans with only slightly more complexity than the animal npcs. 
This means fleshing out basic survival needs and behaviors to fulfill them for the included species. 
The focus is purely on systems not animation nor art nor anything that is too detailed. The goal is to create the foundational building blocks of the game and polish/expand later.
Once the basic simulation is finished, build the gameplay as in the player's UI and interaction with the game world. 
The player will interact with the game through controlling a single npc under mostly similar actions to npcs. 
The player's goal then is to figure out how to increase their control over npcs and therefore the world through this limited access. 
The intent is to provide the experience of actually living in the world rather than being a disembodied god hand which can micromanage everything and everyone. 
To achieve this, inspiration will be taken from the systems in Crusader Kings where control of the state is done through personal relationships and the player's character has an independent personality which can help or constrain the player.
The goal is to build up the simulation and gameplay from the very foundations of a wide variety of academic subjects such as anthropology, climatology, ecology, biology, sociology, etc through a systems focused lens that can reduce these complex systems to simple parts and have complexity be emergent.
