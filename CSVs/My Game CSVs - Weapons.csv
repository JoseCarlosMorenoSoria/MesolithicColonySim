"Include both intentional and improvised weapons, anything that is used to cause damage to a person, animal, structure.",,,mass*wedge angle*material*edge sharpness???,blade length*curve*edge sharpness*material??,material*point sharpness*mass??,mass??,,,,Serves as weight as as a factor in other attributes,Or should this just be a direct result of Mass?,,,
Examples:,,,,"No formula created yet for damage values, just manual values for now",,,,,,,,,,
Axe,pics/items/weapons/axe_*material*.png,,High,,,,,,Medium (1 tile gap with opponent),,,,,
Saber,"weapons could be further reduced to categories such as sword such that a saber is just a pure slashing sword and a rapier is a pure thrusting sword and a kopesh is a pure cutting sword, etc",,,High,,,Can Parry?,Throwable?,Medium,,,,,
Spear,,,,,High,,for now just have everything have a parry/dodge chance,for now just have everything be throwable and use piercing damage and a high miss chance,Long (2 tile gap with opponent),,,,,
Club,should also add stamina drain as an attribute of both weapon mass and attack type,,,,,High,,,Short (adjacent tile),,,,,
Torch,,,,,,,High,Actions (removed for now),Short,,,,,
Riflle,,,,,Extremely High,,,"Actions might not be necessary? Just use probabilty to choose an action with weight towards the higher damage related actions, so a spear is weighted to use a piercing action (thrust), etc.",Far (10 tiles),,,,,
Cannon,,,,,,Extremely High,,Hack (down motion) (cut+blunt),,,,,,
Fists,"<- this should be the default attack, no item needed",,0,0,0,1,,Slash (side/diagonal motion) (slash),,,,also need to figure out a way to distinuish between component materials? so a mace could have a handle of wood or bone and a head of stone or bone,,
Rock,,,,,,Low,,Thrust (forward motion) (piercing+blunt),Short/Long (thrown),,,,need to figure out a way to restrict valid materials per item (no stone swords or grass clubs),
Unused Attributes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Material,Durability,Deterioration Rate,Craft Quality,Crafting Process,Crafting Time,Wielder Skill type and level,"All weapons are NOT consumable ingredients. But their components are. And all weapons and their ammo/parts can be picked up. Only weapons can be equipped, not their parts.","Smeltable (can recover metal, need to therefore have metal be a recorded percentage of mass according to weapon)",,,,,,
"Wood, Stone, Bone, Antler, Ivory, Copper, Obsidian, etc",Chance to break/deform during use (encourages carrying backups),"Should this instead be tied to material types? instead of the actual weapon, maybe factored in with weapon mass as a modifier?",,Involves both the actions involved in crafting (carving/cutting/hammering/etc) as well as the knowledge necessary to craft,,,,,,,,,,
"Material is not part of the csv, but is an attribute in the struct?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Arrows should have a chance to break, those that don't are reusable, copper tips should be smeltable even if broken.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For now, just use the stats below."
